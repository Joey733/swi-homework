## 1、Program with machine language according to the following c.<br/>int_8 a = 1;  int_8 c = a + 3;  
### 1）Write your assembly code & machine code  
STA sum , d<br/>
DECO sum , d<br/>
STOP<br/>
II. machine code<br/>
11000000 0000000000000001<br/>
01110000 0000000000000011<br/>
11100001 0000000000000111<br/>
01010001 0000000000000111<br/>
00000000 0000000000000000<br/>

### 2）Explain machine code execution with the fetch-decode-execute cycle<br/>
• Fetch the next instruction<br/>
• Decode the instruction<br/>
• Get data if needed<br/>
• Execute the instruction<br/>
### 3）Explain functions about  IR, PC, ACC registers in a CPU
IR: 指令寄存器，其中包含正在被执行的指令的一个副本<br/>
PC: 程序计数器，其中包含下一条即将被执行的指令的地址<br/>
ACC:累加寄存器, 专门存放算术或逻辑运算的一个操作数和运算结果<br/>

### 4）Explain physical meaning about vars a & c in a machine
具有类型的内存单元

## 2、简答题 
### 1）What are stored in memory? 
指令和数据
### 2）Can a data or a instruction stored in the same place?
Yes
### 3）Explain Instruction Format with example instructions
指令格式：一条指令由两部分组成，即8位的指令说明符和16位的操作数说明符。指令说明符说明了要执行什么操作和解释操作数的位置，操作数说明符存放的是操作数本身或者操作数的地址。其中，指令说明符又包括操作码、寄存器说明符与寻址模式。例如，对于指令11000000 000000000000000111，指令说明符中1100代表的指令为将操作数载入寄存器中，第5位的0用来指定使用寄存器A，后面3位000表明寻址模式为立即寻址，表明后面的操作数说明符中存储的就是操作数。

## 3、解释以下词汇 
1）汇编语言（Assembly Language）：An assembly (or assembler) language, often abbreviated asm, is any low-level programming language in which there is a very strong correspondence between the program's statements and the architecture's machine code instructions.

2）编译（Compiler）：A compiler is a computer program that transforms computer code written in one programming language (the source language) into another programming language (the target language).

3）命令式语言（Imperative programming）：In computer science, imperative programming is a programming paradigm that uses statements that change a program's state. In much the same way that the imperative mood in natural languages expresses commands, an imperative program consists of commands for the computer to perform. Imperative programming focuses on describing how a program operates. 

4）函数编程语言（Functional programming）：In computer science, functional programming is a programming paradigm—a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs—that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data.

5）过程式编程（Procedural programming）：Procedural programming is a programming paradigm, derived from structured programming, based upon the concept of the procedure call. Procedures, also known as routines, subroutines, or functions, simply contain a series of computational steps to be carried out. Any given procedure might be called at any point during a program's execution, including by other procedures or itself.
