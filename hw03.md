### [](#header-3)使用维基百科解释一下概念

1)`Method of complements`:In mathematics and computing, the method of complements is a technique used to subtract one number from another using only addition of positive numbers. This method was commonly used in mechanical calculators and is still used in modern computers.



2)`Byte`:The byte is a unit of digital information that most commonly consists of eight bits, representing a binary number.



3)`Integer(computer science)`:In computer science, an integer is a datum of integral data type, a data type that represents some range of mathematical integers. Integral data types may be of different sizes and may or may not be allowed to contain negative values. Integers are commonly represented in a computer as a group of binary digits (bits). The size of the grouping varies so the set of integer sizes available varies between different types of computers. Computer hardware, including virtual machines, nearly always provide a way to represent a processor register or memory address as an integer.



4)`Floating point`:In computing, floating-point arithmetic (FP) is arithmetic using formulaic representation of real numbers as an approximation so as to support a trade-off between range and precision. For this reason, floating-point computation is often found in systems which include very small and very large real numbers, which require fast processing times.



1）证明二进制的负数等于X的one's complement+1:
N(X)=2^k-X=［(2^k-1)-X］+1=［2^(k-1)+2^(k-2)+......+2+1-X］+1
而2^(k-1)+2^(k-2)+......+2+1-X即表示X的one's complement
故问题得证。



2）int8_tx=-017 用八进制描述x:
x=761



1)x=0xe1; y=0xffffffe1

x用二进制表示为11100001，要将其扩展至32位，则在其左侧用1补至32位，即11111111111111111111111111100001，再转化为16进制则为0xffffffe1

2)十六进制数的进率是16，二进制数的进率是2，且16=2^4，说明二进制数连续进位4次，等效于16进制数进1位。




`NaN`
In computing, NaN, standing for not a number, is a numeric data type value representing an undefined or unrepresentable value, especially in floating-point calculations.
